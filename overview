I am applying for the Financial Crime Data Scientist role because my extensive, twenty-five-year career in Big Data architecture and digital transformation leadership, specifically within the highly regulated banking sector, including direct experience within the Financial Crime and Credit Risk Centre of Excellence at Santander UK , positions me uniquely for this transition, as I possess the mandatory technical expertise in Python, SQL, and the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem essential for production-quality code development, alongside a proven capability in implementing AI-driven automation frameworks , thereby assuring that I can effectively design, implement, and validate fraud detection models while collaborating strategically with Compliance and Leadership functions to enhance transaction monitoring methodologies and contribute robustly to executive performance reporting.
