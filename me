cknowledging my 25+ years of experience across consulting, services, and technical architecture, coupled with a deep specialisation in Big Data Engineering, DevOps, and CI/CD practices within the banking sector (including direct work in Financial Crime and Credit Risk), I possess the robust technical foundation and strategic leadership acumen to transition successfully into a Senior Developer role focused on high-stakes Financial Crime Intelligence systems, leveraging my expertise as a Security Champion and my ongoing studies in AI/ML.
