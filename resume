With my extensive 25-year background in technology consulting and services, specializing in Technical Architecture, DevOps, and Platform Engineering, coupled with highly relevant and recent experience as an ALM DevOps Engineer at Santander UK, I possess the requisite knowledge of operating systems such as RHEL and Windows, databases, middleware, solution architecture principles, and essential soft skills like strong data analytical and delivery management capabilities, making me exceptionally well-suited and readily capable of excelling in the Platform Engineer/Technical Analyst role for the IT Obsolescence programme.
