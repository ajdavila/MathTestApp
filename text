The session will focus on exploring your technical experience and problem-solving approach through a series of role-related questions.
 
There is no formal prep required, but the conversation will focus on your experience with solution architecture, design thinking, and relevant technologies, so feel free to reflect on any examples you would like to share.
 
Let me know if you have any questions ahead of the time. We are looking forward to continuing the conversation.
